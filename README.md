# HW: Design Static Visualizations

Design a static visualization for the given datasets (sketch on paper or use a digital design tool, such as PowerPoint / Keynote). You may **not** use auto-generated charts in tools like Microsoft Excel or Tableau. The purpose of this assignment is to practice designing data tables and graphs that (i) communicate effectively and (ii) are aesthetically pleasing. Included are two spreadsheets. Think about the data in each spreadsheet and what an analyst looking at that data would care about. You are allowed to derive new variables (attributes) that are combinations of the given ones, but you cannot make up totally new variables or values. 

The datasets include **atl-crime-2020.csv** from [APD Open Data](https://opendata.atlantapd.org) and **gender-pay-gap-US-2014.csv** from [US Census Bureau](https://www.census.gov/).

The assignment has two parts:

## 1. Create a table:
Use the dataset **gender-pay-gap-US-2014.csv** to **create a table** that presents its information as clearly and informatively as possible.

## 2. Create a graph:
Use the dataset **atl-crime-2020.csv** to **create a graph** that presents its information as clearly and informatively as possible.

## FAQ:
1. **Q: Do I need to represent *all* rows and *all* columns?**

A: No. Consider what is important to convey your design, and make sure you show that at a minimum -- it should not be overly simplistic.

2. **Q: Does the graph need to be accurate?**

A: No. We are not going to check if you positioned points precisely. Again, the goal of the assignment is to convey your design idea. 

3. **Q: Can I use python to generate charts?**

A: No. 

4. **Q: Can I use Excel to inspect / analyze data?**

A: Sure. But the design you turn in should not be produced through a spreadsheet program. 

## Submission:
Your document should be in PDF format and with your submission for part 1 and part 2 on pages 1 and 2, respectively. You may wish to provide justification for your designs in 1-2 sentences. For all assignments involving written reports, use Times Roman 11 point type with normal margins, 1.5 line spacing. 

## Grading:
Based on 
- [30%] Appropriate choice of visual encodings
- [20%] Effective execution

each, for the table and the graph.
